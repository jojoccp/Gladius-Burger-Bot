# Gladius Burger - Whatsapp Bot

This is a simple application from a *Whatsapp* robot to a burger shop that automates the user's order.

The entire application was built in **Node.js** as the main language and **PostgreSQL** as the database running through **Docker**.

Also, I used the **wa-automate-nodejs** library which does all the hard work in communicating with the *Whatsapp* api

If you are interested you can find the library **wa-automate-nodejs** at the following link: [WA-AUTOMATE-NODEJS](https://github.com/open-wa/wa-automate-nodejs)



### First of all

First, you must create a new node project with the command: **npm init -y**

After, install the **wa-automate** with the command: **npm i --save @open-wa/wa-automate@latest**

Lastly, you must install **node-postgres** with the command: **npm install pg**


### To Execute

With the Docker running on port **5432**
Enter inside src path, and execute ***node index.js*** on terminal.

Now just enjoy ... because it took a lot of work!
